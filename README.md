# Pong-Game

Classic Pong game created entirely using Python and OOP.

Turtle graphics is used to create a ball, 2 paddles, and the scoreboard.

2 player game, where right paddle is controlled using the up and the down keys, while the left paddle is controlled using the 'w' and the 's' keys respectively.

If a player's paddle misses the ball, score is given to the opponent.

The ball bounces back when it hits the boundary, or the paddle.

Also, the ball's speed increases everytime it hits the paddle.

When the ball misses the paddle, it is reset to the starting position, and moves towards the opponent's paddle.
